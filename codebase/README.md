This folder contains the codebase for the Stop Sign classification project.

Wolfram Mathematica is required to run the .nb files. Those files are used to synthesize the training data. Note that running all of the notebooks will create ~80,000 images (~700MB) on your system. It also takes a while (~2 hours) to run.
If the user does not have Mathematica installed, that is fine. We have included a subset of the training data in the repository so that the cnn-classifier.ipynb file can still train and run the model.
Note: The model performance will be worse than as presented due to this tradeoff.
